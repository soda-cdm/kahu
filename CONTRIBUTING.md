# How to Contribute?

1. Pick an [issue](https://github.com/soda-cdm/kahu/issues) to work on. For first-time contributors, the best would be to pick an issue [tagged good-first-issue](https://github.com/soda-cdm/kahu/labels/good%20first%20issue).

2. If you feel adventurous and would like to take a challenging issue, we would love to have you contribute on issues [tagged help-wanted](https://github.com/soda-cdm/kahu/labels/help%20wanted).

3. There is a [Contribution Guide](docs/contribution-guide.md) that explains how to create a fork and raise PR on GitHub.

4. If the issue involves code changes you need to install development env using this [Development Guide](docs/development-guide.md).

# Scope of Contribution

Contributions are not necessarily in the form of code changes. SODA community can benefit from contributions such as:

1. Blogs

   a. Explain The use of Kahu's features

   b. Describe How to use Kahu for data protection. Please do not shy away from getting as technical as you can.

   c. Put your topic of interest

2. Feedback to the community

   Just helping advance any discussion on Soda Slack, Community meetings, office hours will make a big difference.

3. Talking about Kahu in meetups

   We would certainly encourage users or devs of Kahu to talk about it in open/closed forums. The community can help with logistics such as compiling/feedback on slide-decks, technical diagrams, etc.
